TO USE OLD SAVES:

(1) Unzip the new dwarves into a *NEW* folder.
(2) Copy "data\save" from the old folder into the new folder.  Keep a backup in case something is wrong with the new version.
(3) When you start, your world should be accessible and ready to play.

Unzipping the new dwarves into your old folder will work most of the time, but if files have changed, it can crash, or worse yet, destroy your saves.
