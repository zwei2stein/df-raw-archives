*** SUPPORT BAY 12 ***********************************

Bay 12 Games is fan-supported.  We've put a lot of time and effort into these games, which are all freely distributed, but we can't survive on your feedback alone.  Donations are appreciated.  Visit www.bay12games.com/support.html to see how you can help.

Many suggestions from fans on the bay12games.com and other forums (and the #bay12games IRC channel) have been incorporated over the years.


*** OPTIPNG ******************************************

optipng is bundled into the zip for use to change BMPs into PNGs easily, at least until PNG support is added to DF itself.  The license is included in this folder.  You can get the optipng documentation and source at http://optipng.sourceforge.net.  You can use the compress_bitmaps batch file to convert any BMP in the folder to PNG.  The BMP files are deleted afterward.


*** NOTES ON MODIFICATIONS ***************************

Existing save files will become unusable if any raw/objects entries are removed.  If you change the configuration of the bodies of existing creatures, save files may become unstable.  New additions to the files are not incorporated into existing worlds but will be added to the next world you generate.

We do not accept submissions for the official Dwarf Fortress releases.  Please do not ask for your code, art, sound or raw/objects txt files to be incorporated into the official releases.
